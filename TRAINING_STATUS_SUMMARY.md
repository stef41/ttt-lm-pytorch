**Status:** Finished  
**Duration:** 42 minutes  
**Steps:** 15,000  

**Results:**
- Final PPL @ 1×W: **3,154**
- Final PPL @ 10×W: TTT=**3,222**, SW=**2,755**
- **SW wins at 10×W** (ratio=0.855, 15% better)
- **Issue:** Model still improving at end (undertrained)

---

### 2. W=64 Curriculum (Long) - 🔴 FAILED
**Directory:** `curriculum_exp_long/`  
**Status:** Data loading error  
**Target:** 100,000 steps  

**Issue:** Training script had tokenization error, needs restart

---

### 3. W=128 Curriculum (Long) - 🟢 RUNNING
**Directory:** `curriculum_exp_w128/`  
**Status:** Currently loading dataset  
**Target:** 100,000 steps (50 checkpoints)  
**Started:** Just now  

**Configuration:**
- Training Window: **W = 128 tokens** (2× larger than previous)
- Eval Max Length: **T = 2,560 tokens** (20×W)
- Early Stopping: patience=10, min_delta=50 PPL
- Expected Duration: ~5-7 hours

**Purpose:** Study effect of larger training window on length generalization

## 📊 Key Findings So Far (W=64, 15k steps)

### 1. Surprising Result: Sliding Window Wins! 🏆
At 10×W position, **Sliding Window achieves 15% lower PPL** than TTT:
- TTT @ 10×W: 3,222 PPL
- SW @ 10×W: 2,755 PPL

### 2. Position Matters
- **@ 2×W:** TTT better (full context helps)
- **@ 10×W:** **SW better** (recency bias wins)
- **@ 20×W:** TTT slightly better (extreme range)

### 3. Undertraining Issue
- Model was still improving at step 15,000
- Loss dropping: 10.9 → 5.8 (PPL ~440)
- PPL @ 1×W improved 2.2× in last half of training
- **Need much longer training** to reach convergence

## 🎓 Research Questions for W=128

### Primary Questions
1. **Does larger window improve performance?**
   - Compare W=128 vs W=64 at same positions
   
2. **Does larger window change architecture preference?**
   - Will TTT outperform SW at 10×W with W=128?
   
3. **What's the optimal training window?**
   - Trade-off between performance and extrapolation

### Hypotheses
- **H1:** W=128 will achieve lower absolute PPL
- **H2:** W=128 will show better extrapolation ratios
- **H3:** SW advantage diminishes with larger window
- **H4:** Training is slower per step with W=128

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next few hours)
1. ✅ W=128 training running - monitor progress
2. ⏳ Wait for checkpoint 1 (~30-40 min)
3. ⏳ Monitor training health and speed

### When W=128 Completes (~5-7 hours)
1. Generate evolution plot
2. Compare W=64 vs W=128 results
3. Update conclusions about optimal window size
4. Create comparison visualization

### Future Work
1. **Fix and restart W=64 long run** for proper convergence
2. **W=256 experiment** if W=128 shows promise
3. **Direct comparison** with same checkpoints
4. **Adaptive window** experiments

## 📝 Key Takeaways (So Far)

1. **Training Duration Matters**
   - 15k steps insufficient for 125M model
   - Need 50k-100k steps for convergence
   
2. **Sliding Window is Strong**
   - Outperforms TTT at moderate extrapolation (10×W)
   - Don't underestimate simple baselines
   
3. **Position-Specific Behavior**
   - No single architecture dominates everywhere
   - Choice depends on target extrapolation distance
   
4. **Window Size is Critical Variable**
   - W=128 experiment will reveal optimal range
   - May need multiple window sizes for different tasks

**Last Updated:** October 2, 2025  
**Current Focus:** W=128 training (dataset loading phase)  
**Next Milestone:** Checkpoint 1 evaluation (~40 min)
