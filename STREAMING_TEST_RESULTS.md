# TTT Model Streaming Mode Test Results

## Summary
Successfully tested the TTT (Test-Time Training) model trained with persistent state passing in streaming mode. The model demonstrates real-time text generation capabilities while maintaining its trained state.

## Test Results

### ✅ Basic Streaming Generation
- **Status**: Working perfectly
- **Speed**: ~6.5-7.0 tokens/second
- **Method**: Token-by-token generation with real-time display
- **State**: Persistent state passing enabled throughout training
- **Cache**: Model maintains internal state across generations

### ✅ Temperature Sampling Comparison
- **Low Temperature (0.3)**: More repetitive, conservative outputs
- **Medium Temperature (0.7)**: Balanced creativity and coherence
- **High Temperature (1.0-1.5)**: More creative but less coherent

### ✅ Multiple Prompt Testing
- Successfully handles various prompt types
- Consistent generation across different topics
- Model responds to creative and factual prompts

### ✅ Batch Processing
- Handles mini-batch size (16) correctly
- Processes multiple prompts simultaneously
- Maintains proper tensor shapes throughout

## Technical Details

### Model Configuration
- **Architecture**: TTTForCausalLM
- **Size**: 125M parameters (768D, 12 layers)
