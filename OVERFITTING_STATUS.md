# Overfitting Study - Status Update

## ✅ Successfully Fixed and Launched!

After resolving API compatibility issues, the overfitting study is now **running successfully**.

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed `pack_stride` parameter**: Moved from `evaluate_chunks_only()` call to `PerplexityEvaluator` constructor
2. **Fixed `plot_chunks()` parameter**: Changed `results=` to `res=` 
3. **Added `show=False`**: Prevent matplotlib from trying to display plots in headless environment

### Current Status (as of Oct 4, 2025 03:18 UTC):

**W=64 Experiment:**
- ✅ **RUNNING** (PID: 2020424 + 4 worker processes)
- Initial checkpoint 0 completed successfully
- Untrained model baseline: TTT PPL@1×W = 57,159.0
- Training loop started
- Expected completion: ~6-8 hours from start (around 09:00-11:00 UTC)

**W=128 Experiment:**
- ⏳ **PENDING** (will start automatically after W=64 completes)
- Expected start: ~09:00-11:00 UTC
- Expected completion: ~15:00-19:00 UTC

### Updated `.gitignore`:

Added the following patterns to exclude experiment artifacts:
```gitignore
# Curriculum training experiments
curriculum_exp/
curriculum_exp_w128/
curriculum_w128_training.log

# Overfitting study experiments
overfitting_w64/
overfitting_w128/

### Monitoring Commands:

**Quick status:**
```bash
./monitor_overfitting.sh
```

**Crash monitoring (runs continuously):**
```bash
./monitor_crashes.sh
```

**Check process:**
```bash
ps aux | grep train_overfitting_study | grep -v grep
```

**View live log:**
```bash
tail -f overfitting_w64_training.log
```

**Check latest progress:**
```bash
tail -100 overfitting_w64_training.log | grep -E "(Training:|Step [0-9]+/|Checkpoint)"
```

### What's Running:

The training script is executing properly with:
- 5 Python processes (1 main + 4 dataloader workers)
- GPU memory: ~4.3 GB allocated
- Initial evaluation completed without errors
- Training loop active

### Next Steps:

1. **Wait for W=64 completion** (~6-8 hours)
2. **W=128 will start automatically**
3. **After both complete** (~12-16 hours total):
   ```bash
   python analyze_overfitting.py
   ```
   This will generate comprehensive analysis including:
   - Overfitting detection plots
   - W=64 vs W=128 comparison
   - Best checkpoint identification
   - Length generalization degradation analysis

### Timeline:

- **Started**: Oct 4, 2025 03:02 UTC
- **W=64 Expected Complete**: Oct 4, 2025 ~09:00-11:00 UTC
- **W=128 Expected Complete**: Oct 4, 2025 ~15:00-19:00 UTC
- **Total Duration**: ~12-16 hours

## No Further Action Required

The training is running autonomously in the background. All monitoring tools are set up and ready to use. The experiments will complete automatically and results will be saved for analysis.
